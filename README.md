# Business-Lead-Scoring

Lead scoring is a business methodology, to determine the worthiness of potential customers, referred to in this context as ‘leads’. This is done by analyzing the behavior of customers and their response to various marketing channels. Earlier, this used to be done manually. However, like most other areas today, we see the advantage of Machine Learning to a great extent in the field of Business and Marketing. The process of Lead scoring can be automated almost entirely using machine learning. The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning Model that is capable of processing a certain kind of data, pertaining to customers of a company, a bank here, analyze the trends displayed by this data, and draw inferences about how worthy a customer is, i.e., ‘score’ the ‘lead’.
